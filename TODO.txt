
- saving and loading signal program presets

- integrate with resonanz (create 64bit DLL in Cygwin64 + Java JNI)
  * resonanz command line accepts signal preset files generated using Neuromancer
  * enable showing random stimulus ("test") from the interface
  * add direct support ("measure") to populate database with measurements
  * add direct support ("optimize") to learn neural network model from measurements
  
- implement "execute" using measurement database (initially fabricated data/measurements)
