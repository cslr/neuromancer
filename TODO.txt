
- compile dinrhiw2 and resonanz in windows 64bit

- integrate with resonanz (create 64bit DLL in Cygwin64/MinGW64 + Java JNI)
  * enable showing random stimulus ("test") from the interface
  * add direct support ("measure") to populate database with measurements
  * add direct support ("optimize") to learn neural network model from measurements
  * resonanz command line accepts signal preset files generated using Neuromancer
  
- implement "execute" using measurement database (initially fabricated data/measurements)

- get Emotiv Insight SDKLite and implement implementation that reads (fabricated) values using
  real Emotiv DLL interface
