<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
  <img src="software-window.png" align="right" width="40%">
  Neuromancer Neurostim is a tool that tries to induce different
  mental states and moods and analyze the effect of different pictures and
  stimulus to a user. Unlike typical brainwave entraintment software,
  Neuromancer Neurostim uses measurements (EEG) and machine learning methods 
  and models to generate realtime stimulation sequence (currently pictures and keywords)
  that will try to push brain towards a target state. The aim is try to mimic 
  the way art, music and exciting movies can change watcher's mood.

<h3>What it can do?</h3>
<p>
  Currently Neuromancer Neurostim shows and generates <b>real-time slideshows</b>
  based on measurements. After the stimulation sequence, the program
  reports brain measurements based numbers telling how well program stayed
  in target brain states. When comparing the average distance to target EEG values 
  the software gets 18% smaller errors when compared to random stimulus.
<p>
  In practice, the user selects:
<ol>
  <li>folder containing pictures and a text file with keywords (one keyword per line),
  <li>program measures how user responds to pictures and keywords and 
  <li>after measurements and calculation of a prediction model,
    user can use program to generate stimulation sequences that try to reach
    target state as well as possible.
  <li>It is also possible to measure EEG values for music or other stimulus and 
      then use them as targets to, for example, deepen effect of music so that 
      pictures also try to cause same effect to EEG.

<h3>Installation & Requirements</h3>
<p>
  Neuromancer Neuromancer requires 64bit Windows operating system
  (version 10 or later) and 64bit Java (version 8 or later)
  (<a href="http://java.com/en/download/">www.java.com</a>) to run. 
  Earlier versions of the software might work too but are not tested. 
<p>
  Currently, Neuromancer requires brainwave measurement device 
  <a href="http://www.choosemuse.com/">Interaxon Muse</a> to measure
  how pictures and keywords change brainwaves (and muse-io.exe to send OSC packets).
  Emotiv Insight support is experimental as it has not been tested with a real device.
<p>
  Additionally, during a stimulation program Neuromancer keeps
  all pictures and other media files in memory meaning that you
  need to have enough RAM for this. For normal use, 4-8 GB of RAM and
  fast modern CPU is recommended.

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
  Neuromancer Neurostim is freeware. 
  Decompilation, compilation, copying and other use of the source code
  is prohibited.

<h3>Contact/Support</h3>
<p>
  Software has been developed by Tomas Ukkonen. 
  For reporting bugs and comments, you can contact <b>tomas.ukkonen@iki.fi</b>.
<p>
  If you require consultation or other services related to
  the use of the software or have work offers. I'm more than happy to hear about them.
