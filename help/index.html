<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
<img src="software-window.png" align="right" width="40%">
Neuromancer Neurostim is a program that can be used induce different mental states and moods, 
improve congnitive and mental abilities and analyze the effect of different pictures and 
stimulus to the user. Unlike typical brainwave entraintment software, Neuromancer Neurostim uses scientific measurements and advanced 
machine learning methods and models to generate stimulation sequences (pictures, keywords, audio)
that will try to push brain towards target state. This is similar to the way art, music and 
exciting movies can change watcher's mood.

<h3>What it can do?</h3>
<p>
Neuromancer Neurostim shows and generates <b>real-time videos</b> based on measurements and 
computational models that keeps brain in a certain mood, changes brainwaves or exercises 
brain's cognitive abilities. After the stimulation sequence, the program reports brain measurements 
based numbers telling how well program stayed in target brain states.
<p>
In practice, the user selects:
<ol>
<li>folder containing pictures and optional text file with keywords,
<li>program measures how user responds to pictures and 
<li>after measurements and calculation of 
a prediction model, user can use program to generate videos according that try to reach target 
state as well as possible.
</ol>

<h3>Installation & Requirements</h3>
<p>
Neuromancer Neuromancer requires 64bit Windows operating system (version 7 or later) and
64bit Java (version 7 or later) (<a href="http://java.com/en/download/">www.java.com</a>) to run. 
Earlier versions of the software might work too but you use them at your own risk. 
<p>
You can use Neuromancer Neurostim without a brainwave measurement device like 
(<a href="http://www.emotiv.com/">Emotiv Insight</a>) or <a href="http://www.choosemuse.com/">Interaxon Muse</a>
by using precalculated models but for optimum performance one should buy and connect brainwave measurement 
device to the program.
<p>
Additionally, during a stimulation program Neuromancer keeps all pictures and other media files 
in memory meaning that you need to have enough RAM for this. 
For normal and heavy use, 8 GB of RAM and fast modern CPU is recommended.

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
Neuromancer Neurostim requires commercial license to use. 
You can buy the program (currently 50 USD) from XXX.

<h3>Contact/Support</h3>
<p>
Neuromancer Neuromancer has been developed by Tomas Ukkonen. 
For reporting bugs and support, you can contact <b>tomas.ukkonen@iki.fi</b>.
<p>
Additionally, if you requires consultation or other services related to the use of the software,
neuroprogramming or neuromarketing, brainwave entraintment, need customized special 
version of the software or have work offers. I'm more than happy to hear about them.
