<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
  <img src="software-window.png" align="right" width="40%">
  Neuromancer Neurostim is a tool that tries to induce different
  mental states and moods and analyze the effect of different pictures and
  stimulus to a user. Unlike typical brainwave entraintment software,
  Neuromancer Neurostim uses measurements (EEG) and machine learning methods 
  and models to generate realtime stimulation sequence (currently pictures and keywords)
  that will try to push brain towards a target state. The aim is try to mimic 
  the way art, music and exciting movies can change watcher's mood.

<h3>What it can do?</h3>
<p>
  Currently Neuromancer Neurostim shows and generates <b>real-time slideshows</b>
  based on measurements. After the stimulation sequence, the program
  reports brain measurements based numbers telling how well program stayed
  in target brain states.
<p>
  In practice, the user selects:
<ol>
  <li>folder containing pictures and a text file with keywords (one keyword per line),
  <li>program measures how user responds to pictures and keywords and 
  <li>after measurements and calculation of a prediction model,
    user can use program to generate stimulation sequences that try to reach
    target state as well as possible.
</ol>

<h3>Installation & Requirements</h3>
<p>
  Neuromancer Neuromancer requires 64bit Windows operating system
  (version 10 or later) and 64bit Java (version 8 or later)
  (<a href="http://java.com/en/download/">www.java.com</a>) to run. 
  Earlier versions of the software might work too but you use them at your own risk. 
<p>
  Currently, Neuromancer requires brainwave measurement device 
  <a href="http://www.choosemuse.com/">Interaxon Muse</a> to measure
  how pictures and keywords change brainwaves.
<p>
  Additionally, during a stimulation program Neuromancer keeps
  all pictures and other media files in memory meaning that you
  need to have enough RAM for this. For normal use, 4-8 GB of RAM and
  fast modern CPU is recommended.

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
  Neuromancer Neurostim requires commercial license to use. Buying
  the program gives rights to use the program on a single machine.
  Decompilation, compilation, copying and other use of the source code
  is prohibited.
  You can buy the program from <a href="https://sellfy.com/p/TQ4F/">sellfy.com</a>.

<h3>Contact/Support</h3>
<p>
  Software has been developed by Tomas Ukkonen. 
  For reporting bugs and support, you can contact <b>tomas.ukkonen@iki.fi</b>.
<p>
  Additionally, if you requires consultation or other services related to
  the use of the software, neuroprogramming or neuromarketing,
  brainwave entraintment, need customized special version of the software or
  have work offers. I'm more than happy to hear about them.
